# Roman to Integer

## Problem Statement

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

| Symbol | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five, we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  s = "III"
- **Output:**
  3
- **Explanation:**
  III = 3.

### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  s = "LVIII"
- **Output:**
  58
- **Explanation:**
  L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  s = "MCMXCIV"
- **Output:**
  1994
- **Explanation:**
  M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90, and IV = 4.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
- It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid Roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

## Solution

### Approach

1. **Create a Map**:
   - Use a map to store the integer values of the Roman numeral symbols.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - Initialize a variable `result` to 0 to store the final integer value.
   - Loop through the string `s` and for each character, get its integer value from the map.
   - If the current character's value is less than the next character's value, subtract the current value from `result`.
   - Otherwise, add the current value to `result`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the final integer value stored in `result`.

### Optimizations

1. **Final Variables**:
   - Use `final` for constants and variables that do not change after initialization to help the compiler optimize memory usage.

2. **Map Initialization**:
   - Use a static block to initialize the map once to save time in repeated calls.

3. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Use primitive types and local variables to reduce memory overhead.
   - Avoid creating unnecessary objects within loops.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    private static final Map<Character, Integer> romanNumbersMap = new HashMap<>();

    static {
        romanNumbersMap.put('I', 1);
        romanNumbersMap.put('V', 5);
        romanNumbersMap.put('X', 10);
        romanNumbersMap.put('L', 50);
        romanNumbersMap.put('C', 100);
        romanNumbersMap.put('D', 500);
        romanNumbersMap.put('M', 1000);
    }

    public int romanToInt(String s) {
        final int length = s.length();
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            int currVal = romanNumbersMap.get(s.charAt(i));
            if (i + 1 < length && currVal < romanNumbersMap.get(s.charAt(i + 1))) {
                result -= currVal;
            } else {
                result += currVal;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

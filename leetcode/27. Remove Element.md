# Remove Element

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`. To get accepted, you need to do the following things:

1. Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
2. Return `k`.

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

## Examples

### Example 1

- **Input:**
  - `nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]`
  - `val = 3`
- **Output:**
  - `2`, `nums = [2, 2, _, _]`
- **Explanation:**
  - Your function should return `k = 2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being `2`.
  - It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

### Example 2

- **Input:**
  - `nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2]`
  - `val = 2`
- **Output:**
  - `5`, `nums = [0, 1, 4, 0, 3, _, _, _]`
- **Explanation:**
  - Your function should return `k = 5`, with the first five elements of `nums` containing `0, 0, 1, 3,` and `4`.
  - Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
  - It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

## Constraints

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`

## Solution

### Approach

1. **Initialize a Pointer**:
   - Use a variable `k` to keep track of the number of elements not equal to `val`.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Loop through each element in the array.
   - If the current element is not equal to `val`, move it to the position indicated by `k` and then increment `k`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - The value of `k` will be the number of elements in the array that are not equal to `val`.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int k = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[k++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return k;
    }
}

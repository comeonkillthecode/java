# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Description
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:** 
s = "abcabcbb"

- **Output:** 
3

- **Explanation:** 
The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

### Example 2
- **Input:** 
s = "bbbbb"

- **Output:** 
1

- **Explanation:** 
The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

### Example 3
- **Input:** 
s = "pwwkew"

- **Output:** 
3

- **Explanation:** 
The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Constraints
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Solution

### Approach

1. **Use a sliding window** to maintain a substring of unique characters.
2. **Use a HashMap** to store the characters and their most recent indices.
3. **Initialize two pointers** (`start` and `end`) to represent the current window.
4. **Iterate through the string** with the `end` pointer:
   - If the character is already in the HashMap and its index is within the current window, move the `start` pointer to the right of this character's last known index.
   - Update the character's index in the HashMap.
   - Update the maximum length of the substring.
5. Return the maximum length of the substring.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        HashMap<Character,Integer> map = new HashMap();
        int max = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for(int end=0; end<s.length(); end++){
            char c = s.charAt(end);

            if(map.containsKey(c)){
                start = Math.max(map.get(c) + 1, start);
            }
            map.put(c,end);
            max = Math.max(end-start+1, max);
        }
        return max;
        
    }
}
```
